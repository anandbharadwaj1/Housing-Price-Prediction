# Housing-Price-Prediction
<h2 align="left">Housing Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor Model </h2>

### Description:-
In this project ,I have built and evaluated random forest regressor model using Python. I have used scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The dataset for this project consists of the very popular House Sales in King County in the United States
### Key Task :
- Built random forest regressor model using scikit-learn .
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn .
- Calculated the model accuracy and explained variance score of the model
